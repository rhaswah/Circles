# Circles
Drawing circles is hard for humans. Perfect circles really only exist in theory, and a useful irrational number can be derived from taking the ratio of the circumference to the diameter. In celebration of Pi Day, the Association for Women in Mathematics is holding a circle drawing competition. The problem is: how do you determine who's circle is best? How do you even measure the apparent...... circleness? circularity? eccentricity? How circle is your circle? As a challenge, we have been pooling ideas from IIT professors on ideas of measuring such circleness. Methods suggested include: Circular Regression, Inscribing/Outscribing, Fixed Radius Residual Area, and more.
